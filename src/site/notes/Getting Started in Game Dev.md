This article is *not a guide.*

I repeat: **this article is not a guide.**

I have very little idea of what I'm doing (read: I've watched tutorials and guides for years but have never successfully made a game.)

From what I've learned, I'm effectively at "level 0" of making my game: I have a loose idea ("RPG, top-down/isometric, social sim elements, complex characters"), some knowledge of the software available for my use case (GameMaker, Godot, Unity, RPGMaker, Asesprite/LibreSprite, GIMP/Affinity, Bosca Ceoli/Beatbox...) and some experience with writing narratives and drawing basic art assets (from my time in a writing course and studying animation through half a degree before burning out...)

{insert GIF of "there is now a level 0" from KFP}

I intend on installing some of these tools, testing them out (especially the engines) with microprojects and/or tutorials, and then making some (very slightly) informed decisions.

Wish me luck!..if you feel like it.
