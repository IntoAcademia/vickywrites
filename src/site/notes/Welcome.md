**Welcome to Vicky Writes!**

My name is Vicky, and I'm a student and writer based in Stellenbosch, South Africa.

My New Year's resolution for 2026 is to write, at minimum, the first draft of a novel or novella. In order to apply pressure on myself, I have decided to try something new: *writing in the open* - revealing the entirety of my planning, research, and writing process to the world.

To accomplish this goal, I am using the Obsidian markdown app, along with the Digital Garden plugin to deploy my vault as a static website published to GitHub Pages.

Part of this process will involve reading the works of others, both classic and contemporary - not just letting them wash over me, but in fact, allowing my mind to absorb them through both cursory and detailed analysis.

I will also try to set myself a regular schedule, depending on my university workload, so that I don't have an excuse to procrastinate.

If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, feel free to follow me on the linked social media pages, or make use of the RSS feed to receive updates directly to your email inbox or dedicated RSS Reader.
